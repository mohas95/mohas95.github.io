This tutorial series was made for members of the McGill Ag-Robotics Club and introduces a practical guide to getting started with robotics. The series consists of a selection of hands-on tutorials which covers the practical side of building a robot from scratch. This is by no means a comprehensive robotics course, and is only meant to develop the auxiliary skillsets necessary for robotics. 

McGill Ag-Robotics Club is a collective of students at McGill's Faculty of Agriculture and Environmental Science that come together to learn, share knowledge, and apply skills necessary to model, simulate, manufacture electrical and mechanical systems and build a robot from scratch. The first half of the year is dedicated to hands on teaching, through equipment based tutorials and internal competitions in which student try to accomplish robot tasks based on what they have learned. The second half of the year is dedicated to team building skills in which all members of the team design and build a robot to compete at the annual ASABE student robotics competition.
