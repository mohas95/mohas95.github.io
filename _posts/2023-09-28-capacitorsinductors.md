This lecture was given to second year students taking BREE312- Electric Circuits and Machines. The lecture provides an overview of capacitors and inductors, explaining their fundamental properties, behaviors, and roles in electrical circuits. Capacitors store energy in an electric field and resist voltage changes, while inductors store energy in a magnetic field and resist changes in current, both playing crucial roles in circuit design. The lecture also covers key equations, circuit behavior under DC conditions, and the relationship of these components with current, voltage, and energy storage.
